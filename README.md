# Fitness
This was my quiz on creating getters and setters.
This program helps demostrate the ability to do getters and setters as well as inheritance. 


How this program should function is the following.
1: Download the ZIP files. 
2: Open up Fitness and Person within an IDE. 
3: run code and see results. 


How the code functions. 
Looking at the person class. You must first create all your attributes and verify the clasasification of each attribute.(public, protected and private)
you then want to create constructors. These are made to allow the end users to input various amounts of information they have to input. This also allows the information to be detailed or very vaugue. 
The next portion is creating a loop of information to determine the amount of BMI each person has and where they are currently at on that chart. This loop needed to have alot of math vairables and equations. 

After creating the equation we want to ensure that both files. Person and Fitness are in the same project as Fitness is built to look at Person class by calling various veriables from that class. 

-------------------------------------------------------
After completing Person class we are moving into Fitness class. 

First thing you want to do in Fitness class is to ensure that you are creating a new person within each line of code. Everyone is different and creating a new Person with a new name can help you make different variables for different people. After you create a new name for each person create the variables for these people after calling a new name. 


After calling new variables to each unique name. you want to print out the data they contain. This is your final step within the code. You want to print their name.firstname and the calculateBMI as this will print the name you provided. The second thing you print out is calculateBMI reason for this is it will gather the data and print where they fall on a BMI scale.
